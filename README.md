# Intro

This is simply my space where I'm updating my learning process. I will also write some comments about myself, as I learn to maybe help other beginners better understand the process.

## What am I learning?

* Anything web dev (HTML, CSS, JacaScript etc.)
* Python 
* Go 

## Why am I learning?

Durning one of my many career crises durning years without an idea what I'm planning to do I've stumled upon the CAWEB master at the university of Strasbourg, since then, despite my initial degree I'm planning to pursue my studies this way.

# Who am I?

I'm a 23 year old art history student who simply decided to pursue his other passion - technology. Despite my age I still do not have any degree (I'm currently at the Licence 3 level, the French will understand). 

I live in France but I'm Polish, I moved here 4 years ago with my girlfriend (now wife). I didn't know any French and I've learned on the go, durning that process I have also developped a strong intrest in languages, I speak polish, english, french and german; and I'm planning to learn also italian and maybe an asian language or a semitic one.
